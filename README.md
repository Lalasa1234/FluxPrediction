# FluxPrediction

**Problem Statement**
Flux means flow, critical heat flux is that limit beyond which heat can no longer flow from the solid to the liquid. At this point, vapour starts getting formed. Operating the system beyond this limit leads to overheating and failure. Hence predicting this value becomes important.

**Objective**
Critical Heat Flux Predictor using Torch's Sequential Model
