### Critical Heat Flux Prediction 🔥🔥💣
#### From Inception ➡️ to Deployment ⬅️ using PyTorch
___

**Business Application for Nuclear Reactors**

Flux means flow, critical heat flux is that limit beyond which heat can no longer flow from the solid to the liquid. At this point, vapour starts getting formed. Operating the system beyond this limit leads to overheating and failure. Hence predicting this value becomes important.

**What does the code contain**
1. Data Preprocessing and EDA
2. Torch Dataset and DataLoader preparation
3. Torch Custom Model building and evaluation
4. Optuna hyperparameter tuning on model architecture and optimizer's learning rate
5. Optuna visualizations
6. Torching saving and loading of model state (incl. weights and biases)
